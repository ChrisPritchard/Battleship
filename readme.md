# Battleship

Implementation of the classic pen-and-paper/plastic guessing game. Each player has a ten by ten grid on which to place their ships in the first phase: 1 Carrier, 2 Battleships, 3 Cruisers, 3 Destroyers and 2 Submarines (Numbers selected arbitarily)

Then each player picks a shot on the other players board until one player has lost all their ships, leaving the other the winner.

Built in F#, referencing a MonoGame library I have built.
