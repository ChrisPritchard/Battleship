# Battleship

Implementation of the classic pen-and-paper/plastic guessing game. Each player has a ten by ten grid on which to place their ships in the first phase: 1 Carrier, 3 Battleships, 4 Destroyers, and 2 Submarines (Numbers selected arbitarily).

Each game turn, alternating players pick a shot on the other players board until one player has lost all their ships, leaving the other the winner. For this implementation one player is human, and the other AI.

Built in F#, referencing a MonoGame library I have built.
